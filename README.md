# Analysis-via-for-loop-in-Python

Bank Data Analyzed with Vanilla Python

Objective: To describe key characteristics of the dataset, and print a small report of the findings within a specific, predetermined format. Determine when the greatest increase in profits occurred, and the magnitude of that increase. Determine when the greatest decrease in profits occurred, and the magnitude of that decrease. Determine the average change in profits, and the total number of months.

A note about the dataset: This dataset contains only two columns: One with the date, and one with the magnitude of profit change.

Enjoyable Success: Producing the correct result required skipping the first line of the CSV file, via the next() function. This made it possible to treat every row equally in the subsequent for loop. Incrementing a month_counter was key. Building out the for loop was all about starting with the most simple function, and adding functionality within the loop successively. It was very helpful to visualize exactly what I was doing with Excel, and then translating that functionality into the for loop.
